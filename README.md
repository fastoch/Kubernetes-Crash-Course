# Why K8s?

The problem it's solving is "managing containers at scale".  
When having many containers across multiple VMs, it becomes very difficult to manually handle things such as failovers, updates, or scaling.  

This is where Kubernetes (or K8s) comes in.  
This is what we call a "container orchestrator", and its key benefits are:
- automation
- sacalability
