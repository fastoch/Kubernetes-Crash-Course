# Why K8s?

The problem it's solving is "managing containers at scale".  
When having many containers across multiple VMs or servers, it becomes very difficult to manually handle things such as failovers, updates, or scaling.  
This is where Kubernetes comes in.  

Kubernetes is what we call a "container orchestrator", it orchestrates the deployment of containers over multiple machines, and its key benefits are:
- automation
- scalability
- high-availability (HA)

# Getting started with Kubernetes

The best way to learn Kubernetes is by installing and playing with Rancher Desktop.  
When you install Rancher Desktop, you'll also get **kubectl**, which is the CLI for Kubernetes.
